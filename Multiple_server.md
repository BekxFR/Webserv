In Nginx, when multiple server blocks are defined for the same host:port, the first block defined is considered the default server. This means that it will be responsible for handling requests that do not match any of the other server blocks defined for that host:port.

For example, suppose you have two server blocks set up in your Nginx configuration file:

Diff
Copy
Insert
New
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    ...
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name test.com;
    ...
}

In this case, both server blocks are listening on port 80 (HTTP) and have a different server_name directive. If a request comes in for example.com, it will be handled by the first server block because it matches the server_name directive. However, if a request comes in for a different domain name that is not defined in any server block, the first server block (the default server) would handle the request.

This behavior is important to keep in mind when setting up server blocks in Nginx. It's crucial to define the default server block correctly so that it can handle all requests that don't match any of the specific server blocks, ensuring that no requests are accidentally dropped or routed incorrectly.
